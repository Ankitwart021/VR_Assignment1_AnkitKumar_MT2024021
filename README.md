## README

### Project Overview
This project involves image processing techniques, including edge detection, segmentation, and panorama stitching. The goal is to analyze and manipulate images using computer vision techniques.

### How to Run the Code
The code is implemented in Jupyter notebooks and executed using Google Colab. Follow the steps below to run the project:

1. Upload the required input images to the **Input_Images** folder.
2. Open Google Colab and upload the provided Jupyter notebooks (**Edge_Detection.ipynb** and **panorama.ipynb**).
3. Execute the cells in the notebooks sequentially to process the images.
4. The output images will be generated and stored in the **Output_Images** folder.

### Methods Chosen
- **Edge Detection:** Implements image processing techniques to detect edges in images.
- **Segmentation:** Segments images into different regions based on pixel characteristics.
- **Panorama Stitching:** Combines multiple images to create a seamless panoramic view.

### Results and Observations
- The edge detection method successfully identifies image boundaries.
- Segmentation techniques improve object differentiation within images.
- Panorama stitching creates a continuous image from multiple frames.

### Visual Outputs
- The results, including edge detection, segmentation, coin counts, and the final panorama, are saved in the **Output_Images** folder.
- Ensure that the labeled visual outputs are referenced in the README file for clarity.

### Folder Structure
- **Input_Images**: Contains the raw images required for processing.
- **Output_Images**: Stores the results generated from the notebooks.
- **Edge_Detection.ipynb**: Notebook for edge detection and segmentation.
- **panorama.ipynb**: Notebook for generating panoramic images.

### Dependencies
Ensure the following dependencies are installed before running the notebooks. These are pre-installed in Google Colab, but if running locally, install them using pip:

```
!pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib
```

### Execution
The code is designed to run without any additional intervention. Simply execute the cells in order, and the required outputs will be generated automatically. If running locally, ensure that all dependencies are installed.

### Notes
- Make sure all input images are placed in the correct directory before execution.
- Output images should be verified after execution to confirm correct processing.
